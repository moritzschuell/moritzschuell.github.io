Abstract
======
Application of agile software development methodologies in large-scale organizations is becoming increasingly common. However, working with multiple teams and on multiple products at the same time yields higher coordination and communication efforts compared to single-team settings for which agile methodologies have been designed originally. With the introduction of agile methodologies at scale also comes the need to be able to report progress and performance not only of individual teams but also on higher aggregation of products and portfolios. Due to faster iterations, production of intermediate work results, increased autonomy of teams, and other novel characteristics, agile methodologies are challenging existing reporting approaches in large organizations. Based on 23 interviews with 17 practitioners from a large German car manufacturing company, this case study investigates challenges with reporting in large-scale agile settings. Further, based on insights from the case study, recommendations are derived. We find that combining reporting and agile methodologies in large-scale settings is indeed challenging in practice. Our research contributes to the understanding of these challenges, and points out opportunities for future research to improve reporting in large-scale agile organizations by goal-setting and automation.
