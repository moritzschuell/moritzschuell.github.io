Hello!

I'm a Phd student in Information Systems at [University of Bayreuth](https://www.wi.uni-bayreuth.de/de/index.html). I do my research at [FIM Research Center for Information Management](https://www.fim-rc.de/wiss_mitarbeitende/moritz-schuell/) and work as a full-time technology and IT-strategy consultant at [Fraunhofer FIT](https://www.wi.fit.fraunhofer.de). In my research and professional work, I focus on topics around enterprise architecture management, IT-strategy, and the management of artificial-intelligence-based applications.

Before starting my PhD, I studied Information Systems at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/) where I graduated with high distinction. On the practical side, I've worked as a software engineer for several years, most recently at SAP, where I focused on containerizing business applications and lifting them to K8S. As a scholar in the [Fastlane program](https://www.bmwgroup.jobs/de/en/students/entry-programmes/masters-programme.html), I worked on the agile working model of BMW, focusing on reconciling project-centered strategic initiatives with the product-centered organizational structures of daily business.

Outside of workâ€š I spend most of my time doing the triathlon sports (swim, bike, run).
